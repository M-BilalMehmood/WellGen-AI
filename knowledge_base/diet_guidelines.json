    "content": "To lose weight safely, create a caloric deficit of 500-750 calories per day. This leads to approximately 0.5-1 kg weight loss per week. Daily calorie needs vary: sedentary men need 2000-2500 cal, sedentary women need 1600-2000 cal. Active individuals need more. Never go below 1200 cal/day for women or 1500 cal/day for men without medical supervision."
